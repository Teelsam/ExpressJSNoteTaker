## Description 

Here we have an application that allows the user to create and store plans. It uses expressjs and heroku to run and organize files on a server. Aswell as has front end content for a user to interact with. 


## Usage
Pressing the blue Get Started button opens to a different route with the notes stored from the last time you used the site. Here you can create a new note by typing in a title and note body. When there are characters in the title a floppydisk save icon appears in the top right which will save your note.
